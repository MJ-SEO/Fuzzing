In this study, I studied the concept of Fuzzing according to the steps in [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/).

According to the steps of studying, I created a Fuzzer, to be exact, ```Greybox Mutation-based Fuzzer``` in C.  Originally, the example codes in [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) were implemeted in Python.



According to the order below, you can find the entire concept of ```Greybox Mutation-based Fuzzer``` step by step.
