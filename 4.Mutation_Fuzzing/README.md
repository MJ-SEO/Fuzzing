# Mutation-Based Fuzzing

## Mutation

In this chapter, I will add the ```Mutation``` concept in previous Fuzzer.

Mutation means slightly changing a given input.


Previous fuzzing ```inputs``` are randomly generated. After the mutation concept, we perform Fuzzing through ```mutated inputs``` at a given meaningful input.

This allows you to test programs, such as http, that receive certain types of input. Also it performs better testing in many case.
